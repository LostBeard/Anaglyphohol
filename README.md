# Anaglyphohol

Anaglyphohol is a web browser extension that let's you view images on the web in anaglyph 3D. It supports green magenta, and red cyan glasses. View image search results in 3D on google.com, bing.com, and yahoo.com. Use Anaglyphohol on on almost any website. 

## Development
Anaglyphohol is developed using Blazor WebAssembly. The 2D to 3D magic is thanks to the amazing monocular depth estimation machine learning model [Depth Anything](https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small).
